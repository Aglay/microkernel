Yet another microkernel
=======================

Licensed using the MIT Licence: see LICENSE file for details.


This is not a great project. Surely not now.
This is not an Operating System. Surely it won't be it.
This is not a microkernel too. Though it's surely the main goal of this project.
I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land; you'll forgive for being such a newbie...

This... thing... is intended to become a microkernel, x86 based OS.
It gets started by GRUB (or any other multiboot compliant bootloader), and works in Protected Mode.

============

    GNU gcc	4.4.4-14 (4.4.5 prerelease)
    Nasm	2.09.01 (you can easily migrate to another assembler)
    GNU ld	2.20.1
    GNU Make	3.81

    Qemu	0.12.5



Build Instructions
==================

    make
    make image	(will need 'sudo')
    make run	(will nedd 'qemu')
