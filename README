Yet another microkernel
=======================

This is not a great project. Surely not now.
This is not an Operating System. Surely it won't be it.
This is not a microkernel too. Though it's surely the main goal of this project.
I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land; you'll forgive for being such a newbie...

This... thing... is intended to become a microkernel, x86 based OS.
It gets started by GRUB (or any other multiboot compliant bootloader), and works in Protected Mode.
