This is not a great project. Surely not now.
This is not an Operating System. Surely it won't be it.
This is not a microkernel too. Though it's surely the main goal of this project.
I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land; you'll forgive for being such a newbie...

PS:
    this is an x86 multiboot compliant microkernel which does nothing interesting at the moment.

Dev tools:
    GNU gcc	4.4.4-14 (4.4.5 prerelease)
    Nasm	2.09.01 (you can easily migrate to another assembler)
    GNU ld	2.20.1
    GNU Make	3.81

TODO:
    * Some mistakes with the IDT...
    * I strongly suspect I did something wrong with the irqs handler...
    * To read tons of manuals...
