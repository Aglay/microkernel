Yet another microkernel
=======================

Licensed under the terms of the MIT Licence: see LICENSE file for details.


This is not a great project. Surely not now.
This is not an Operating System. Surely it won't be it.
This is not a microkernel too. Though it's surely the main goal of this project.
I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land; you'll forgive for being such a newbie...

This... thing... is intended to become a microkernel, x86 based OS.
It gets started by GRUB (or any other multiboot compliant bootloader), and works in Protected Mode.

    GNU gcc	4.4.4-14 (4.4.5)
    Nasm	2.09.01
    GNU ld	2.20.1
    GNU Make	3.81

    Qemu	0.12.5



Build Instructions
==================

    make
    make image	(will need 'sudo')
    make run	(will nedd 'qemu')



TODO
====

    * kb.c needs repairing and other keymaps (at least the italian one, for me!)
    * multitasking fixes (is it safe? does it work properly?)
    * user mode
    * fat fs
    * ext2
    * elf
    * pci, usb, etc.
    * vesa driver
    * tcp/ip, etc.
    * etc. etc. etc...
    * to read tons of manuals...
