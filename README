Yet another (micro?)kernel
==========================

Licensed under the terms of the MIT Licence: see LICENSE file for details.

This is not a true, functional kernel or OS. This is a toy to play with: I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land and I came up with this; you'll forgive me for being such a newbie...
The... thing is currently designed for x86 cpu only, gets started by GRUB (or any other multiboot compliant bootloader), and works in Protected Mode. It's in a very early state of development and, of course, it is absolutely not useful.



Dependencies (tools it is known to work with)
=============================================

    GNU gcc	4.5.3-1
    Nasm	2.09.08
    GNU ld	2.21.0
    GNU Make	3.81

    Qemu	0.14.0



Build Instructions
==================

    make	(compile and glue together source files)
    make image	(create a bootable image; will need 'sudo')
    make run	(boot and test the image; will need 'qemu')
