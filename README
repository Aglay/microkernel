Yet another microkernel
=======================

Licensed under the terms of the MIT Licence: see LICENSE file for details.


This is not a great project. Surely not now.
This is not an Operating System. Surely it won't be it.
This is not a microkernel too. Though it's surely the main goal of this project.
This is a toy kernel to play with: I'm trying to learn something about kernel's land; you'll forgive me for being such a newbie...
This... thing... is intended to become a (microkernel), x86 based.
It gets started by GRUB (or any other multiboot compliant bootloader), and works in Protected Mode.

Note: it's in a very early state of development. And, of course, it is absolutely not useful. Not even for learning purpouses I guess.
